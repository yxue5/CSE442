## Project Description:

Project Eroica will be a fast paced 2.5d fighting game that pits players in pvp matches against one another. The goal is simple, eliminate your opponent's health before he/she eliminates you. The unique part comes in the advanced technical tactics a player can perform that makes matches feel like a sport.

4) AI that can perform multiple attacks

## User Story:
I want to play the spiritual successor to Grand Chase's fast pace pvp game. This will be a 2d fighting game with 3d models in which a player is pitted against another player(which will be controlled by AI for now but if we can make it another person in the future via multiplayer we will try to do that). Each player has an automatically regenerating hp and mp bar. The player will use the arrow keys to move around, and the Z key to attack. Players can combine arrow key inputs and the Z key to create different moves.
